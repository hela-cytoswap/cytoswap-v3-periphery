# Deployment addresses

The latest version of `@cytoswap/v3-core`, `@cytoswap/v3-periphery`, `@cytoswap/swap-router-contracts`, and `@cytoswap/v3-staker` are deployed at the addresses listed below. Integrators should **no longer assume that they are deployed to the same addresses across chains** and be extremely careful to confirm mappings below.

These addresses are final and were deployed from these npm package versions:

- `@cytoswap/v3-core`: [`1.0.0`](https://gitlab.snapresearch.io/swapnity/cytoswap-v3-core)
- `@cytoswap/v3-periphery`: [`1.0.0`](https://gitlab.snapresearch.io/swapnity/cytoswap-v3-periphery)

The source code is verified with Etherscan on all networks, for all contracts except `CytoswapV3Pool`.
We are working on getting the `CytoswapV3Pool` contract verified with Etherscan.
